Project 2: Clustering Algorithms

Description:  In this project we have implement three clustering algorithms to find clusters of genes that exhibit similar expressionprofiles: K-means, Hierarchical Agglomerative clustering with Single Link (Min), Density Based DBSCAN and Kmeans Mapreduce. We have implemented the first 3 in C# using Microsoft Visual Studio as a platform. Kmeans MapReduce was implemented in Ubuntu Hadoop system.

To directly execute the code, go to the "Project2\Code\Kmeans-hirar-dbscan\Project2\bin\Debug\Project2.exe".

Instructions 
* The file "Project2.sln" is present in the "Project2\Code\Kmeans-hirar-dbscan" folder.
* Open the file in Microsoft Visual Studio.
* Build the solution by selecting 'Build->Build Solution'.
* To run the file click on start.
* Enter the required paraenters. 
* By selecting the input dataset, the program runs.
* All the result of the clustering are displayed and along with the internal indexes values.
